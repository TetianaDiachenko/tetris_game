# Tetris game

[Demo](https://tetianadiachenko.github.io/tetris_game/)

## Rules

* Click on the Start button to beginning the game.
* You can click Start button again to make a pause.
* You bring down blocks from the top of the screen. 
* You can move the blocks around, either left to right and/or you can rotate them.
* The blocks fall at a certain rate, but you can make them fall faster if you’re sure of your positioning.
* Your objective is to get all the blocks to fill all the empty space in a line at the bottom of the screen; whenever you do this, you’ll find that the blocks vanish and you get awarded +10 of Score.

As the basis of the game I used the video [The Code Tetris: JavaScript Tutorial for Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAUn1Lom6dw&list=PPSV)
